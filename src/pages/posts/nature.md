Losing a beloved animal companion is one of the most difficult things a pet parent can go through, the accompanying grief is both intense and unpredictable, similar to how one might grieve the passing of a dear friend or family member. But there are ways to honor a dear pet, to celebrate their spirit and their memory. 

## Have a Memorial Service

A memorial service is an opportunity to bring together the people who meant the most to your pet (and/or the people who mean the most to you) and talk about what made him or her so special. Consider holding a memorial at your pet’s favorite park or even just at your home, if that’s where they spent most of their time. Ask people to all share at least one memory of your pet, and take the floor yourself to talk about how much your pet meant to you and what your favorite things were about them. Taking an hour or so to come together and honor your pet can bring a lot of comfort during the early stages of grief.

## Donate to an Animal Organization

You may want to donate to the shelter you adopted them from, or to a cause that resonates with you, such as an animal cancer foundation if your pet passed away from cancer. Many shelters will even allow you to sponsor one of their residents, paying a monthly fee of your choice toward their treats, toys, and medical care. Taking the money you would have spent on your pet and putting it toward other animals will help turn the loss into more love.

## Adopt Another Animal Or Volunteer

Sometimes the best way to honor a pet’s life is to give another animal the opportunity to experience the love that they did. Adopting a new pet won’t replace the one who you lost, but it will inevitably bring more joy back into your days. Plus, there’s nothing better for the heart than the knowledge that you’ve saved a life. Don’t rush anything, though; if you’re not ready to adopt again, that’s okay. Instead, you might want to start volunteering at your local shelter. You’ll get the cuddles and kisses you’re missing without having to make such a huge commitment.

## Commission a Custom Piece of Art

Searching on Etsy, Instagram, Facebook, and even a general search on Google will show plenty of artists who specialize in creating gorgeous works of art from a pet’s photo. Generally, you’ll be asked to submit between one to five photos of your animal companion, and from there, the artist will make you a custom piece. Choose from oil paintings, prints, watercolors, sketches, and more, or even opt to have your pet crocheted onto a throw pillow or screen printed onto a blanket. The options are endless and allow your creative freedom to really revel in your pet’s unique personality and all they brought to your life.
