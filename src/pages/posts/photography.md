**PetMemorial.ML is here to help.** The death of a beloved dog is a heartbreaking time in any owner's life. Whether it's sudden or you've had time to ready yourself, there is nothing that truly prepares you for losing the animal you love.

A creative and special way to celebrate the life of your beloved dog is to have an image of their nose or paw printed onto a dainty necklace or bracelet.

Handmade memory quilts are a wonderfully personal way to remember your pet using a collection of your favourite images. A talented seamstress will be able to create one for you, but there are plenty available online if you would prefer this instead.

Planting a tree or flower in your garden to signify your pet's life will provide you with a beautiful daily reminder of the memories they gave you. Whether they had a favourite spot in your [garden](https://www.countryliving.com/uk/homes-interiors/gardens/a26389116/small-garden-design-ideas-gardeners-world-joe-swift/) or a place they enjoyed digging around in, choose a special location outside to plant something new.

### Compiling a memory box

Creating your own memory box is a cheap and easy way to compile all of your favourite memories in one place â€” and it's great for children to get involved with too. Gather photographs, dog toys, blankets, and other keepsake items to place into a box. This can then be kept somewhere safe in the home and revisited throughout the years.

### Create a photo album

With so many photographs taken digitally on our phones, it's not often they get put into physical photo albums anymore. But a creative way to remember the life of your pet is by posting them as a Photo Gallery on PetMemorial.ML
